# Priam

## Purpose

 - Are you a student who has a new idea or concern they would like to make known to the university administration?
 - Are you unsure of the resources or means necessary?
 
 A solution presented by me, Isaiah Freeman, is Priam, web application that has the goal of making the desires of students more visible to faculty and administration at your university.
 
 ## How?
 - The Priam system is simple: you might consider it a voting system. Students have the ability to create an account, and propose changes they would like to make to the university in a short post.
 - Categories can be added to the posts to better organize the nature of their requests.
 Other users have the ability to view these public posts and have the optoon to upvote them.
 - Other users have the ability to iew these public posts and have the option to upvote them.
 - These posts are anonymous. No one will know the author of the post.
 - There are no comments. No judgement necesary.
 - The only metric is upvotes.
 
 There are also basic searching methods to allow you to search posts by name, title or date. You can also sort by category.

## User Stories (Subject to change as more features are added)

## Run Locally
 - Before anything, check out the pre_setup.md to follow how I set up authentication and the server.
 - Want to start small? Not sure if you want to dedicate to a full application?
    - Check out the [Lite version](https://www.github.com/kingtechnician/priam_lite) of this application (non-downloadable, basic design)
 - Otherwise, follow the instructions at application_setup.md to set up the application locally.

## Committing

- Helping out with this project is heavily encouraged! I am an undergraduate student still learning React and many other technologies, so your guidance will help me make this project even greater and more useful.
- I want the documentation to as simple as possible to readable both for experts as well as beginners. If you propose a project change, be sure to also provide some Markdown documentation about the steps you took, or a very detailed explanation of what you did in the description of your commit. 

## Next Steps

- Are there ways we can fortify the code more?
- Can we create a service that creates this application on behalf of others? (Perhaps a website or app that creates personalized Priam systems).


## Sponsorship

Managing the serves, authentication, and hosting can be a monthly price, and as I implement this in my university, these costs are likely to increase. If you can, please consider donating. Funds will be used not only to support the technology to manage this app in my campus, but also for future endeavors of making change through software.
